<h1>A student majoring in web development at the University of Arkansas at Little Rock with fresh experience in graphic & web 
    design.</h1>
<p>I have a passion for UI/UX design (user interface/user experience) and am interested in pursuing a career in UI/UX. 
I have experience in HTML, CSS, Javascript, & UI/UX; skills that I will demonstrate throughout my website. 
Also, I have over 10 years of customer service experience that has refined my communication & listening skills, thus making me a 
valuable member of a development team. Please enjoy my website. Iâ€™ve chosen a garden theme to represent my growth in the
knowledge of web development, design, communication, and even a little bit of philosophy.</p>
