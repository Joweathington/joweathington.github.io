        <dd>Most of us wait for life to happen to us, but we all have the potential to make life happen. Making life happen doesn't 
            mean doing whatever we want, but doing what we can with what we know to create that something that increases our chances 
            (and the people around us, because we are not alone) of experiencing the fullness of life. Whatever we need to know, 
            we learn. This is how we grow from being simply adults to becoming free adults. A free mind can imagine, create, and 
            distribute diverse cultural expressions. Freedom can't be given. Freedom can't be taken. Not all of us are free, but 
            within all of us is the process to freedom that has always been here waiting to mature us into the fullness of life; 
            if only we allow ourselves to submit to its process and <u>actively participate</u> in following its instructions. 
            For a visual of growing into freedom, check out my video below, 
                        <em>Watch Me Grow</em>.
